Hello all. I just purchased a great R-70 and found this to be an excellent rig. I would love to have others that have this radio to share there experances and mods that they found worked,(including parts to buy etc.)

I am not at home, put as soon as I am, I will take a photo of my rig and shack in the making.

73's

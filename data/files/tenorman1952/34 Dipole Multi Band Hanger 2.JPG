Mast is two 10' (3 m) sections of 1 1/4" (32 mm) diameter antenna mast.  This 20' mast is attached with brackets to the wood fence behind my workshop.  The mast is approximately centered along the fence.  

Each leg of the dipole is 68' long, with 2' on the ends doubled back and clamped, making the legs effectively 66' long.  This makes the dipole an 80 meter 1/2 wave centerfed dipole, but it will also work for receiving on higher frequencies.

A friend made the center piece from 1/4" (6.35 mm) plexiglass, with an SO-239 socket mounted.  There are holes for rope to pull it up with a pulley.

The photos show how I tied the insulated stranded 14 gauge wire to the center section.

End insulators were also made from the same plexiglass.

The holes were originally drilled 1/4" diameter (6.35 mm), but I used 1/4" rope.  I was certain the sharp edges of the holes would cut the rope and wires.  The holes were redrilled to 5/16" (8 mm), and the sharp edges were chamfered by lightly touching them with a 1/2" (12.7 mm) drill bit.

The standoff at the top of the pole is simply 3/8" (9.5 mm) threaded rod.  A hole was drilled through the top of the mast, the threaded rod pushed through, and a locknut used on each side.  Locknuts were also used to position the pulled.  After this was assembled the rod and nuts were sprayed with matching gray Krylon spray paint.  The top of the mast was packed with epoxy putty to prevent the tubing from collapsing when the nuts were tightened, or from wind shaking the threaded rod.

You can see the end insulators, photo 14.  Rope was used to secure the end insulators to the eyebolts at each end of the fence.

I have a 90 degree adapter on the socket so the coax will hang down more naturally.  There is also a rope tied to it to support the weight of the coax, so it is not just hanging from the connector.

I used SealAll to seal the cable couplings and the connections on the back of the SO-239 socket.  After everything was assembled, testing with a digital multimeter showed a resistance of 8 megohms from center conductor to shield on the radio end of the cable.  Disassembling and testing one piece at a time it was finally determined the SealAll on the back of the socket was causing the 8 megohm reading.  Removing the SealAll on the connector fixed that problem, with the whole system now reading infinite resistance.

Coax is RG8. 

And this afternoon from my home here on the Louisiana coast I was able to hear a friend in Wisconsin send me a test signal on the 20 meter band.  I also listened to a guy in NY work other hams in FL, TX, Guatemala, and other places.

This 80m dipole also works well for the AM/MW Broadcast Band.
